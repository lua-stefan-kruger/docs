## 💡 Recommendations

### For Immediate Use
The documentation is already highly functional:
- New users can get started
- Core concepts are explained
- Basic workflow is documented
- Template is explained

### To Complete the Documentation
Recommended order:
1. **Create remaining API reference pages** - Most valuable for developers
2. **Create remaining CLI pages** - Essential reference material
3. **Create tool example pages** - Helps with learning by example
4. **Create remaining template pages** - Advanced topics
5. **Clean up old files** - Final polish

### Each Remaining Page Needs
- Clear explanations following established patterns
- Code examples (from source files provided)
- Mintlify components (Cards, Tabs, etc.)
- Cross-references to related pages
- Consistent formatting

## 🚀 How to Complete

### Using the Source Files
All content is available in the attached markdown files:
- `API_REFERENCE.md` - Source for API pages
- `CLI_REFERENCE.md` - Source for CLI pages
- `TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md` - Source for template pages
- `TOOL_EXAMPLES.md` - Source for examples
- `GETTING_STARTED.md` - Already converted
- `README.md` - Additional reference

### Follow Established Patterns
Look at completed pages for:
- Component usage (CardGroup, Tabs, Steps, Accordion)
- Code block formatting
- Cross-reference links
- Section organization
- Writing style

### Estimated Effort
- Each API page: ~30-45 minutes
- Each CLI page: ~30-45 minutes
- Each example page: ~20-30 minutes
- Each template page: ~30-45 minutes
- **Total remaining**: ~8-10 hours
